Below is a README.md file for your GitHub repository, styled using GitHub Markdown syntax and conventions. It’s tailored for your "LibraryAppStyled" project, emphasizing the award-winning UI enhancements and functionality we’ve implemented. This version uses GitHub-specific styling (e.g., badges, headers, code blocks, emojis) to make it visually appealing and professional on GitHub. I’ve included placeholders for your username and screenshots, which you’ll need to customize.
